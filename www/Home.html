        <h1>EDTox</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The EDTox is an R shiny application to train a classifier for prediction of endocrine disruption potential of a compound  using machine learning  on toxicogenomics data. In this approach, starting from the molecular initiating events (MIEs) of a compound, a random walk with restart (RWR) is performed on a gene-gene co-expression network build using toxicogenomics data to identify the genes perturbed by the compound in question. The resulting list of perturbed genes is then used for fast gene-set enrichment analysis (FGSEA) to retrieve the activated pathways. The pathway activation scores obtained from FGSEA are used to train a GLM based classifier to predict the endocine disruption potential of a compound (defined as EDC-class probability score). The pipeline also allows an option to use pareto solution to select the optimal proportion of edges from the original network that will be used as input for RWR and the number of genes with highest probability after RWR to be taken into FGSEA. Validation of the model can be performed by k-fold cross-validation.<br>

        As a pilot study, we have trained classifiers based on toxicogenomics data from DrugMatrix, open TG-Gates and LINCS databases. An additional classifier based on a protein-protein interaction network from STRING database has also been trained. In each case, only liver genes were included in the initial network for training the classifiers. A sample set of 197 endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and 1336 negative controls were used as training set. The negative controls were selected such that they had maximum dissimilarity with the EDCs based on their MIEs. The MIEs of the compounds were retrieved from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). The accuracy of the trained classifiers can be viewed on the summary tab of this application.<br>

        While users can train a new classifier based on their own network and training set compounds, the application also provides a way to calculate EDC-class probability scores based on the 20 classifiers trained using the toxicogenomics data mentioned above. The application can also be used to view the EDC-class probabilities of the 12,278 compounds in CTD predicted using  the EDTox pipeline and compare it with the ToxPi scores from ToxCast. </p>
